Course: Visual Interfaces to Computers

Final project that takes images of event flyers and create a Google Calendar file that can then be uploaded to a user's Google Calendar account. 
The program extracts 3 types of data from the image - name, date, and time of the event - and formats it into a .csv file. This project involves
preprocessing the image to remove irrelevant objects, image text extraction (OCR), and implementing a spell-checking algorithm.
